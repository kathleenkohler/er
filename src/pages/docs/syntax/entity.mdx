# Entity expression

An `entity` declaration consists of the keyword "entity" followed by its name, the entity it inherits from (if any), and a list of its attributes.
The following example declares an entity with the name "Dog" which has the attributes "name", "breed", "age" and the key attribute "d_id".

```erdoc
entity Dog {
  d_id key
  name
  breed
  age
}
```

## Entity attributes

An entity attribute may be declared as a key attribute by adding the keyword `key` after the attribute name. Also, the ERdoc language allows attributes
to be composite following the `attribute: [part1, part2, partN]` syntax. The following example shows an entity with a composite attribute that is also
part of the key of the entity.

```erdoc
entity Company_Branch {
  company_name key
  address: [street, city, zip] key
  revenue
}
```
